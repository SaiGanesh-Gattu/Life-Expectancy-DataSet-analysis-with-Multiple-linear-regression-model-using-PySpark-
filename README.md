Life expectancy is a critical indicator of a country's overall health and well-being, 
influenced by various socio-economic, environmental, and health-related factors. 
Understanding these influences can help policymakers and health professionals 
develop targeted interventions to improve public health. This project aims to 
develop a multiple linear regression model using PySpark to predict life expectancy 
based on a comprehensive dataset that includes factors such as GDP, healthcare 
expenditure, literacy rates, and mortality rates.

The use of PySpark for this project leverages its powerful distributed computing 
capabilities, allowing efficient handling and processing of large datasets. By 
COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING utilizing PySpark, we can perform complex data transformations, conduct 
extensive exploratory data analysis, and build robust predictive models at scale. 
This approach ensures that our analysis is not limited by computational constraints, 
providing more accurate and generalizable insights.


The project involves several key steps: data collection from reliable sources, data 
cleaning to handle missing values and ensure consistency, feature engineering to 
create meaningful variables, and exploratory data analysis to identify potential 
predictors of life expectancy. Following these preparatory steps, we will develop a 
multiple linear regression model to quantify the relationship between life 
expectancy and the identified predictors. The final model aims to offer valuable 
insights into the determinants of life expectancy, helping to inform health policies 
and interventions across different regions. Additionally, the model's predictions 
can be used to forecast future trends and identify areas in need of improvement.


Life expectancy, a cornerstone of public health metrics, reflects not only the quality 
of healthcare but also broader societal factors. By leveraging PySpark's robust 
distributed computing framework, this project ensures scalability and efficiency in 
analyzing extensive datasets encompassing diverse socio-economic indicators. 
Through meticulous data cleaning and feature engineering, we aim to enhance data 
quality and uncover nuanced relationships between predictors like GDP, healthcare 
expenditure, literacy rates, and mortality rates. Exploratory data analysis will delve 
into regional disparities and highlight significant predictors, guiding targeted 
interventions and policy decisions. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach 
promises to yield a sophisticated multiple linear regression model that not only 
predicts life expectancy accurately but also informs proactive health strategies and 
anticipates future demographic trends. This project thus underscores the 
transformative potential of data-driven insights in advancing global health 
outcomes and equity
